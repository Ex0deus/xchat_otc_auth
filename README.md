OTC Auth Tool for XChat2 IRC Client
=======================================================
This is the first version of this tool
updates are planned for the future.

Currently to use it you need use this script, once
loaded... you need to do /otcauth auth 'keyid' 
where 'keyid' is your gpg key id you used to register.

The script also assumes the nick your using is the nick
your wanting to auth with. This will be changed in a 
later version.

Input is welcome.
